# CPP Start
`cppstart` is a simple command-line tool to initialise a reasonable C++ project.

## Get `cppstart`
Not quite ready yet! Soon you'll be able to do `pip install cppstart` to get `cppstart` :)

## Creating a C++ project
Say you want to create a new C++ library called "foo" in the current directory. Then just do:
```shell
cppstart foo
```
That's it!
